MOBILITY THROUGH INVESTMENT
MARIA DE FÁTIMA AMANTE AND IRENE RODRIGUESMOBILITY THROUGH INVESTMENT
Economics, Tourism, or Lifestyle Migration?
Narratives of Chinese and Brazilian Golden
Visa Holders in Portugal
Maria de Fátima Amante and Irene Rodrigues
Introduction
This chapter aims to contribute to the enduring discussion of the conceptual
boundaries between migrants and tourists (Williams and Hall, 2000) by looking at
privileged mobility (Cohen et al., 2015; Croucher, 2012) and focusing on inves-
tors. The discussion draws from ongoing research on the motives, expectations,
and life experiences of Chinese and Brazilian investors (and their families) hold-
ing Golden Visas (hereafter GV) in Portugal. In contrast to economic and forced
mobility, the movements of relatively affluent individuals and the super-rich (one
segment of privileged mobility) have only recently begun to attract researchers’
attention. A burgeoning literature on privileged mobility deriving from citizen-
ship, class, and/or cultural capital (Kunz, 2016) has gradually emerged, showcasing
how studying this underexamined form of mobility offers opportunities for “better
highlight[ing] the nature and implications of global inequality” (Croucher, 2012).
Furthermore, studying privileged mobility can be useful in deconstructing long-
held notions surrounding migration, such as the “binary divide between work and
leisure,” the dichotomies of “home” and “away” (Cohen et al., 2015, p. 156), and
the overlapping features of various travel categories (Amit, 2007) among which we
find that of tourists. Examining this phenomenon promises to overcome the typi-
cally “skewed image of migrants and immigrants as predominantly non-Western,
non-White, non-elite subjects” (Kunz, 2016, p. 89). As anthropologists, from
where we stand, it is also an opportunity for “studying up” (Nader, 1972; Ortner,
2010; Souleles, 2018).
Investment as an avenue for obtaining a residence permit and eventually citi-
zenship is a strategy used by those seeking opportunities to move abroad (Rogers
et al., 2015; Gamlen et al., 2019). It is also embraced by many governments seeking
capital infusions (Džankić, 2018; Parker, 2017). Since the 2008 global economic

permits had been granted to GV family members of all nationalities (SEF, 2021).
Most GV holders channel their investments to the real estate sector (9,170 GVs out
of 9,767), which is the fastest and cheapest option.
Both Chinese and Brazilians had strong migration relationships with Portu-
gal well before the GV program, with established communities in the country.
Brazilians form the largest group of migrants in Portugal, and the Chinese com-
munity is the sixth-largest immigrant group in the country (SEF, 2019). Originally,
both Brazilians and Chinese arrived in Portugal as workers driven by opportunities
for economic security. The Chinese began arriving in the 1980s, becoming an
important community during the 1990s and 2000s (Amante and Rodrigues, 2020;
Gaspar, 2017). Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964–1985) produced an initial stream
of political refugees in the 1980s followed by highly skilled migrants attracted by
Portugal’s expanding economy after its 1986 admission into the European Eco-
nomic Community (Padilla, 2006; Peixoto, 2002). At the dawn of the millennium,
the “proletarianization of Brazilian migration” (Padilla, 2006) kept the numbers
high. More recently, before the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed grow-
ing numbers of more affluent arrivals (privileged mobility) from these two nations,
with the growth of student and investor mobility. Together, these have contributed
to both these communities’ enlargement and diversity (Amante and Rodrigues,
2020; França and Padilla, 2018). Portugal’s attractiveness as a place for investment
and study has been propelled by the country’s increasing popularity as a tourist
destination.3
Scholars approach the well-recognized “symbiotic relationships between tour-
ism and migration” (Williams and Hall, 2000, p. 5) from several different per-
spectives. Generally, research has detailed how migration generates tourist flows
(Jackson, 1990; Morrison et al., 1995), and how tourism may also generate migra-
tion flows (Monk and Alexander, 1986). This chapter highlights a slightly different
approach: By examining foreign investors, we seek to discern how migration and
tourism overlap in constructing the investor category. In doing so, we follow two
lines of inquiry: First, since the investor is a political category, we examine how the
state’s strategy for promoting the country as an investment hotspot entails co-min-
gling economic and tourist attractions. Second, we discuss the investor category
from the inside by looking at how migration and tourism intertwine as investors
subjectively construct the category of “the investor.”
We consider this an interesting case for exploring the blurred boundaries of
migration and tourism for several reasons beyond those mentioned earlier. First,
the GV program coincided with a particularly favorable moment for tourism in
Portugal. In recent years, the country has received a plethora of World Travel Awards,
with Lisbon (2018) and Porto (2017) achieving special acclaim. Perhaps not sur-
prisingly, GV holders invested primarily in Lisbon and Porto and adjacent regions.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipated the rise in investor visa grants due
to Portugal’s growing attractiveness as a tourism destination (Mendes, 2017; Kräh-
mer and Santangelo, 2018). But last year (2020), the grant totals decreased (from
1,245 in 2019 to 1,182 in 2020) and the relative number of Chinese and Brazilian

================================================================================

GVs also fell slightly (SEF, 2019, 2020). Accordingly, to a certain extent, mobility
through investment can be conceived of as consumption-led, and therefore more
closely entangled with tourism or with a specific kind of migration, namely, life-
style migration. Thus, we explore how the Portuguese State has promoted itself
using not only economics and tourism but also lifestyle imaginaries to construct
the investor category.
Second, the policy does not require that grantees and their family members
reside in the country to maintain their residence permits. GV holders are only
required to visit Portugal annually, remaining seven days in the first year, and 14
days in subsequent years. Hence, it appears the state does not expect GV holders
to become migrants. However, the predominance of real estate investment suggests
that GV holders may be interested in acquiring second homes abroad to access a
particular lifestyle, valuing a esthetics over (or in tandem with) economics. In short,
GV holders constitute a case of lifestyle migration (Benson and O’Reilly, 2009a;
Knowles and Harper, 2009; Torkington, 2012; Benson and Osbaldiston, 2014).
Our approach to the concept of lifestyle derives from Pierre Bourdieu (2010) for
whom different lifestyles result from relationships between economic, cultural, and
social capitals, and the choices available in specific social contexts. Thus, consump-
tion (and leisure) is associated with specific lifestyles. Social class is indeed an ele-
ment of investors’ actions. But, when examining investors’ motives for applying for
a Portuguese GV, we choose to highlight the subjective dimension, stressing how
these self-articulated motivations construct the idea of lifestyle itself. For Chinese
emigrants in prior eras, political and economic uncertainty at home has been cited
as major push factors for pursuing a desired lifestyle elsewhere, as seen with Chi-
nese emigration from mainland China and Hong Kong in the 1990s (Li, 2005).
Our findings, however, suggest that this is not quite the case with contemporary
Chinese GV holders. For upper–middle-class Brazilians, lifestyle visions were seen
as more closely tied to social class and identity mobility, which are entwined with
ethnic and racial identity (Robins, 2019, p. 1). However, our findings complicate
other scholars’ analyses of upper–middle-class Brazilians’ motives for pursuing life-
style migration. Our interviews with Chinese and Brazilian GV holders suggest
that the very notion of what constitutes lifestyle migration needs to be reassessed
and re-envisioned to accommodate a broader range of pursuits than is classically
portrayed in the literature.
Privileged Mobility and the Investor
Privileged mobility is a very broad concept and includes various categories
of mobile people whose mobility experiences do not include the hardships –
economic deprivation and endangered lives – usually associated with economic
and forced mobility (Rodrigues, 2013; Sayad, 2004). Investors are but one cat-
egory of people who can be viewed as privileged migrants, a condition shared
with highly skilled professionals, students, sojourners, retirees, and expatriates
(Croucher, 2012), among others. What makes all these categories of mobile

================================================================================

--- PÁGINA 7 ---

Mobility Through Investment 221
people privileged is, first, the conditions under which they move and settle in
the receiving country, and second, their lifestyle in that country. Regarding the
first, privileged mobile people have access to resources that can soften the migra-
tory experience: they have time to travel, and they are either wealthy or enjoy
cultural capital. These kinds of resources allow them to overcome the usual dif-
ficulties migrants experience (securing housing, jobs, schools for their children,
etc.). Moreover, privilege is not only shaped by affluence but by the migrants’
citizenship, as demonstrated by research on North Americans who moved to
South American countries and enjoyed benefits due to their passports from pow-
erful nations (Croucher, 2012; Benson and O’Reilly, 2009b). Thus, nationality
can also play a significant role (Benson, 2013). Finally, we must attend to how
the divide between privileged and “regular” migrants is subjectively constructed.
That is, people categorized as privileged mobiles do not necessarily think of
themselves as migrants, nor are they necessarily thought of as such by the state
(Amante and Rodrigues, 2020). The literature tends to assume those engaged in
privileged mobility are not working; therefore, some authors argue for a close
relationship between privileged mobility and leisure, connecting this flow with
categories such as lifestyle migration (Benson and O’Reilly, 2009a), amenity
migration (Moss, 2006), international retirement migration (Scuzzarello, 2020),
or even residential tourism (Rodriguez, 2001; McWatters, 2009).
The formal category of privileged mobility addressed in this chapter – the
investor – was created in 2012 through an amendment to Portugal’s 2007 For-
eigner’s Act. This amendment redefined the relationship between entrepreneur-
ship, business, and migration in Portugal. More importantly, it also redefined how
migration is seen, because, despite varying definitions of the concept, a persistent
trait of migration is that the immigrant lives in the host country. As noted earlier,
this is not mandatory for investors granted a GV in Portugal, nor for their rela-
tives who obtain permits for family reunification. So, how do we conceptualize
the investor? Is he/she an immigrant if he/she can choose not to live in the host
country? Is he/she more akin to a residential tourist?4
To understand privileged mobility and the specific case of the investor, we con-
ceptualize the “investor” both as a category of analysis and as a category of practice
(Brubaker and Cooper, 2000; Brubaker, 2013). In doing so, we recognize that,
although interdependent in some ways, the two categories do not necessarily over-
lap. What the state defines as a suitable applicant for a GV does not necessarily
coincide with GV holders’ subjective constructions.
Methodology
When we began researching privileged migration, we were aware of the chal-
lenges of “studying up” (Powdermaker, 1966). Participant observation and quali-
tative interviews used in classic fieldwork are not always viable when researching
the powerful within our own societies (Ortner, 2010). GV holders are part of a
difficult-to-access economic elite: They are not only from multiple nations, but

================================================================================

--- PÁGINA 8 ---

222 Maria de Fátima Amante and Irene Rodrigues
they are also highly diverse and nationally and internationally delocalized. Unlike
anthropologists studying small-scale communities via participant observation, we
could not find a community of GV holders as such. The absence of a “definite
community” and the challenges of accessing elites were difficulties noted by Hort-
ense Powdermaker (1966) in her research on Hollywood power brokers, long
before Laura Nader encouraged “studying up” (1972). As Powdermaker observed,
these factors precluded “a constant and seemingly casual participant observation”
(Powdermaker, 1966, p. 213). Given these challenges, we decided that qualitative
research through interviews would be the best strategy for accessing subjective
understandings.
Nader’s observations that elites “don’t want to be studied; it is dangerous to
study the powerful; they are busy people; they are not all in one place, etc.” (1972,
p. 302) reverberated in our minds as we embarked on our study. For many months,
we struggled to gain access to people who were granted GVs and ultimately used
gatekeepers (real estate agents directly involved with high-profile real estate proper-
ties, migration lawyers, and other Chinese and Brazilian migrants living in Portu-
gal). From the outset, we had greater access to the Chinese than to the Brazilians,
as one of us had prior experience with Chinese and we both lacked Brazilian
networks in Portugal.
This chapter draws on data from 18 interviews with Chinese GV holders and
other Chinese migrants already established in Portugal, both workers and entre-
preneurs, all involved in providing formal and informal consulting services to the
Chinese interested in obtaining a GV in Portugal. The Chinese investors we inter-
viewed came from Changsha (Hunan Province), Shanghai, and Beijing. Conver-
sations were mainly conducted in Chinese Mandarin (with investors and family
members) and some in Portuguese (through intermediaries). These interviews
were hand recorded, with additional memories of the interview expanded after-
ward.5 These notes were subsequently transcribed for content analysis. We gained
access to our nine Brazilian interviewees (investors, their family members, and
brokers) via migration lawyer offices, real estate agents, and by tracking down indi-
viduals previously interviewed in newspapers. These participants came from the
States of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Bahia in Brazil.
The first interviews, conducted in 2019, occurred in participant-selected loca-
tions, either public places (e.g., cafes, restaurants, and travel agencies), their homes,
or offices (for the intermediaries). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020
interviews were conducted via online platforms (mostly WhatsApp for the Brazil-
ians and WeChat for the Chinese). Also because of the pandemic, despite our initial
plans, participant observation was not possible. During semi-structured interviews,
we asked about investors’ lives in their home countries, decisions to leave, oppor-
tunities associated with obtaining a GV, and prior expectations and life experiences
in Portugal. We also conducted content and discursive analyses of qualitative and
visual data from the AICEP-Portugal Global – Trade and Investment Agency’s
(hereafter AICEP) website (this is the Portuguese government’s business develop-
ment agency especially directed at attracting foreign investment). Finally, we drew

on statistical data from the Foreigner and Border’s Office (hereafter SEF) to con-
textualize the GV policy.
Invest in Portugal! What Does the State Want?
Over the past 13 years, the Portuguese government has embraced different strate-
gies to enhance foreign investments, beginning in 2009 with the Non-Habitual
Residents Program. This program offered tax incentives for foreign investors.6 In
2012, the state launched the GV Program to stimulate Third Country Nationals’
(TCN) investment in the real estate sector which was in deep crisis at the time.
This program established various investment options: in exchange for a residence
permit, interested TCNs could invest either a minimum of half a million euros in
real estate, make capital transfers of at least one million euros to Portuguese banks,
or create a business with at least 30 employees.7 In addition, in 2007, the Portu-
guese governmental agency AICEP was reconfigured as a front desk for investment
in Portugal, charged with providing support services, counseling, and contacts for
companies involved in investment processes. Beyond providing information about
investment and trade in Portugal, the agency’s website is dedicated to persuading
individuals and corporate businesses to invest in Portugal.
Our discourse analysis of this website8 revealed five rationales aimed at draw-
ing foreign investors to Portugal, namely: (1) economic; (2) human resources; (3)
innovation and technology; (4) geographic, historical, and cultural; and (5) tour-
ist attractions.9 For this chapter, we concentrate on the last two rationales, which
highlight the intersecting terrain between tourism, migration, and elite investor
mobility. On the site, geographic, historical, cultural, and touristic allure comprise
almost as many reasons offered to entice potential foreign investors as the eco-
nomic set alone. Although these geographical, historical, and cultural rationales
are presented separately on the site, they comprise important tourist assets and the
state combines them to present an image of Portugal as a “globally positioned”
and “connected country” (expressions used in the promotional film), both in the
past and today. Accordingly, the AICEP website highlights information such as the
average temperature at noon in summer and winter and the many tourism awards
received by the country’s primary cities (e.g., Best European Country to Visit, Best
City in the World to Invest, and Best Place in the World to Enjoy Retirement).
These tourist and economic “facts” are all spotlighted in the film as reasons to
invest.
In the AICEP’s promotional film, economics, innovation and technology, and
manpower indicators are enfolded with touristic and cultural images and data about
Portugal. The video opens with three young adults on a sailboat off the coast of
Lisbon. As potentially attractive economic facts are presented, images of science,
technology, and innovation are merged with tourist images of Praça do Comércio
and Lisbon’s riverside. The film concludes with tourism and travel indicators and
returns to the image of the three young adults on the sailboat berthing at Lisbon’s
Parque das Nações dock, which is situated in an attractive, modern living and

working zone. In this way, by combining economy and tourism to draw investors,
this governmental agency targets not only economic investors in general but also
tourism, leisure, and residential investment, in particular.
Recognizing the impossibility of competing with powerful economies in the
contest for overseas investors, the government employs certain internationally
widespread stereotyped images of Portugal. These tropes of Portugal as a tourist
destination of sun, sea, and leisure become valuable assets for attracting foreign
investors. In the next section, we draw on our interviews with GV investors, their
family members, and intermediaries to analyze how these kinds of images of Por-
tugal have figured into their decisions to invest in Portugal.
Migration or Tourism? or Both? Investors’ Narratives
Some studies have stressed economic performance as a key motivation for GV
investments in Portugal, associating foreign investment (and the need to expa-
triate capital) with the urban tourist boom and the growth of tourist amenities.
Historical ties between the investors’ countries and Portugal are also considered
relevant (Montezuma and McGarrigle, 2019). Finding an economic “safe haven” is
reported as one reason for investing in real estate. According to some (Montezuma
and McGarrigle, 2019), this is the primary objective for many Chinese and Turkish
investors in Portugal. From our research with Chinese investors, the properties
purchased are either left vacant or rented to co-nationals or others for residential
purposes: They do not appear to be rented to tourists.10
Since the GV is an investment visa, one would expect that GV seekers would
highlight economic investment as a primary motivation. However, the Chinese
GV holders and their family members we interviewed do not mention capital
investment or China’s real estate market pressures as the key motivations driving
their GV applications. As noted earlier, most Chinese GV applicants and holders in
Portugal tend to apply for family reunification, thus increasing the incoming flow
beyond that of the GV holders alone. This practice in tandem with our interviews
suggests that the main motivations for moving are family-related (Amante and
Rodrigues, 2020). As Xi, a male Chinese real-estate agent residing in Lisbon stated:
“Many investors leave their children with grandparents in Portugal and spend most
of their time in China taking care of their businesses.” The literature suggests edu-
cation and economic investment as the primary reasons for this permit’s appeal in
Portugal and elsewhere (Montezuma and McGarrigle, 2019; Ampudia de Haro
and Gaspar, 2019; Robertson and Rogers, 2017). The Chinese GV intermediaries
we interviewed indicated that Chinese families were leaving China for numerous
reasons: To escape pollution, pursue better educational and social environments for
their children, and avoid rising housing costs that were pushing middle-class resi-
dents of larger Chinese cities into outlying regions. Some Chinese GV holders and
their family members confirmed that concerns about family health and education
were strong motivations (and a Chinese real estate agent reported that many GV
holders were coming from China’s most polluted cities). As Huang, a male Chinese
GV holder explained,

================================================================================

Mobility Through Investment 225
This desire to go abroad started when our second son was five years old and
got a very serious respiratory illness. It was coincident with a period of high
pollution levels in Beijing, so we wanted to get out and go to a healthier
place.
Similarly, Zhang, the wife of a Chinese GV holder told us,
We decided to leave China because of the environment (the pollution), but
it was mainly due to our son’s education. . . . He was suffering great anxiety
due to the rankings pressure – Chinese children suffer very much.
The intense social pressure to be successful was also noted as one of the causes driv-
ing emigration from China in previous migratory flows to Portugal, long before
the GV policy (Rodrigues, 2013). Literature on migration and social reproduc-
tion in China has noted the growing importance of higher education certificates
from prestigious “Western” universities in the accumulation of social capital among
the Chinese middle class (Waters, 2006; Tsang, 2013). To overcome the intense
competition Chinese students face when entering Chinese universities, many par-
ents choose to send their children abroad, where they can enjoy less stressful lives:
Chinese GV-holding parents living in Portugal feel their children need not spend
as many hours studying to succeed. Likewise, one of the informal intermediaries
interviewed said that her acquaintance’s Chinese parents and grandparents were
considering applying for a GV and buying a house in Portugal to enable them to
send their children there in the future. Although the children were still very young,
concerns over their future education were the main motivation for the investment.
In short, for the Chinese mainlanders we interviewed, the investment opportunity
is not the primary motivation for applying to the GV Program: Education oppor-
tunities and family health are the reasons that most stood out.
The topic of leaving China for political and economic reasons is very sensitive
among mainland Chinese. Although not a reason volunteered by investors and
family members themselves, it is difficult to ignore these reasons when discussing
Chinese GV holders’ rationales for leaving China. Significantly, the Portuguese GV
program has aroused great interest among Hong Kong Chinese for overtly political
and economic reasons.11 Rising fears of instability have emerged since the recent
approval of the national security law in Hong Kong and Macau, which reduces
the autonomy of these areas from China (activating laws approved during the 1997
transfer of Hong Kong’s sovereignty and the 1999 transfer of Macau’s sovereignty).
This may be prompting increasing numbers of Chinese GV holders to move to
Portugal, as occurred with the Chinese relocating to Canada in the late 1990s (Li,
2005). During our fieldwork, we heard of several Hong Kong GV holders who
do not reside in Portugal. It seems possible that although some Hong Kong GV
holders are not currently residing in Portugal, possessing a GV may offer a kind of
insurance should they need to leave Hong Kong for political reasons.
Some of our interviewees mentioned intentions to leave China, but not spe-
cific desires to target Portugal. Rather, these Chinese GV holders were interested

in living in Canada, the United States, and Italy. Thus, Portugal was not the first
choice, but the second available option. As Wang, the Chinese wife of a GV holder,
articulated,
We came because our only son wanted to move to the United States, though
we could not make it. Then the emigration agency we had consulted to go
to the US advised us to consider Portugal. We had no previous relations with
Portugal, we came for a visit and decided to apply. . . . I feel very comfort-
able in Portugal, the education is good, my son is very content, and he also
has the opportunity to experience other things compatible with a European
lifestyle.
And Huang, a male Chinese GV holder, detailed,
At first, we applied for Canada, but the process was too long, they asked for
many documents and, in the end, we didn’t make it. It was rejected. Then,
in 2013, the emigration agency told us about the possibility of Portugal. We
didn’t know anything about Portugal, I knew Ronaldo and I knew it was
next to Spain. So, I searched for information. Then, I realized that it was a
European Union country and that it was part of the Schengen Agreement,
and that it would be good for traveling and even doing business. I sought
information from the League of Chinese in Europe and Portugal. I wanted
to know if it was good for children and what the weather was like. Then they
told me that the summer was long and hot and that children got much less
sick than in China because the winter is shorter and milder. So, we thought
it would be a good idea to come and see, and we liked it. The emigration
agency [in China] took care of everything for us: they took care of the house
business, all the paperwork of the purchase, the visa, as well as the school
enrollment for our children.
The GV holders and their family members we interviewed all came from large
cities in China – Beijing, Shanghai, and Changsha (in Hunan Province). They
were middle-class families, professionals, or businesspeople with ambitions to live
outside China, but without many of the resources – including language skills – that
would enable them to enter the United States or Canada, traditionally the most
desired destinations for Chinese pursuing life abroad. They all came to Portugal
as families, with children and even grandparents. Those with ongoing business
ventures in China faced family separations, with some members in China and oth-
ers in Portugal. However, such separations may be transitory, since many Chinese
GV holders, once in Portugal, start looking for local business opportunities. Oth-
ers, professionals working for private companies in China, pursued professional
jobs upon arrival in Portugal. However, none mentioned professional ambitions
as a motivation for applying for the GV. One GV grantee, Huang, said he and his
wife were enjoying living in Portugal so much that they decided to enlarge the

family with a third child. Their interest in Portugal began while they were still
residing in China and were introduced to Portugal by immigration agencies that
partnered with real estate companies in Portugal. We also heard of others who were
more informally introduced to Portugal (without immigration agencies), by Chi-
nese individuals who had been commissioned by Portuguese real estate agencies to
attract GV clients. In fact, the Chinese community in Portugal was very excited
about the program back in 2013, and many Chinese migrants plunged into the real
estate sector, viewing drumming up Chinese GV applicants as an attractive business
opportunity (Amante and Rodrigues, 2020; Gaspar, 2019).
Not all Chinese families invest in real estate before relocating to Portugal. For
some families maintaining businesses in China, the investment comes after resid-
ing in Portugal. Nevertheless, the real estate investment is what opens the door for
them to consider acquiring a GV and a longer-term relationship with Portugal.
Cui, the wife of a Chinese GV holder explained,
I came to Portugal with my mother and my teenage son only, while my hus-
band stayed in China looking after our businesses. After traveling in Europe,
I decided that I wanted to live here. Though Portugal was not my first choice –
I preferred Italy – we are pleased with our choice.
For GV holders, at least initially, Portugal’s advantage is not so much its intrinsic
appeal, but rather its geopolitical position in Europe.12 For Chinese GV holders,
Portugal’s location in Europe and its association with the Schengen Agreement
offer possibilities for both business and tourism. Some Chinese GV holders explore
Portugal as tourists, often with an eye for potential investments, treating Portugal
as a point of departure for tourism in Europe. As Cui, the already quoted wife of a
Chinese GV holder explained,
I had already traveled to Europe for tourism, to Italy, and I liked it very
much. After that, I thought about coming to Europe and I found the oppor-
tunity in Portugal. In the meantime, since our arrival, I have already traveled
with my mother and son to various European countries for tourism.
In contrast to the Chinese investors, Portugal offers a slightly different kind of “safe
haven” for Brazilian investors. Research data collected by Joaquim Montezuma
and Jennifer McGarrigle highlighted that “this group is primarily seeking a safe
investment setting and a relocation option to exit Brazil rather than high returns”
(2019, p. 14). Our empirical data, gathered through interviews with Brazilians’
GVs, revealed a financially diverse group of people with desires to invest in Portu-
gal and particular lifestyles there once settled. In this group, we find people who
are not only extremely wealthy but also members of the upper-middle class, with
enough money in the Brazilian banking system to acquire Portuguese GVs, which
they use to avoid the delays generally associated with the country’s highly bureau-
cratic migration process.

alist Jair Bolsonaro figure into Brazilian investors’ desires to leave the country. As
Sandra, a Brazilian female GV holder in her early 40s recalled,
Five years ago, when I came [to Portugal], the Golden Visa was a good
resource. Since then, it has changed a lot . . . But I feel that, back then, the
people coming were older than me, with more money . . . That group went
a lot to Cascais13. In the last two years, more people of my own age are com-
ing, with a similar lifestyle, that is not having a lot of money but wanting to
have a different life. Five years ago, when I came, it was at the time of Dilma’s
impeachment, which I was totally against. Those [supporting the impeach-
ment] are precisely the group of people who now voted for Bolsonaro. It’s a
right-wing group of people, who five years ago were running away.
Both political and economic motivations can be inferred from our interviewee’s
words. The super-rich she refers to as “older right-wing Brazilians” (who arrived
during or immediately after Dilma’s impeachment) were not confident about the
Brazilian economy and sought a “safe haven” for investments. Those who arrived
more recently, upper-middle-class Brazilians like Sandra, are escaping a conserva-
tive government and allude to political factors as primary reasons for leaving.
Why did they choose Portugal? More often than not, in contrast to the Chinese
migrants, scholars cite “lifestyle orientations, historical factors, as well as shared lin-
guistic and cultural terrain” (Montezuma and McGarrigle, 2019, p. 14) as impor-
tant factors. Although we concur that there is a cultural connection, it is worth
noting that
Portugal has never featured in the Brazilian imagination as a developed “First
World” country. Instead, Brazilians share a general sense of superiority vis-a-vis
the Portuguese, who are the butt of many derogatory jokes in Brazil and
whose country was perceived as the ‘backwater’ of Europe.
(Torresan, 2011, p. 235)
So, beyond the cultural factors cited in the literature, for the upper-middle-
class Brazilian GV holders, Portugal’s appeal lies in its low investment threshold
compared to other potential destinations: The financial investment requirement
for a Portuguese GV is more manageable than the financial thresholds required
by other European countries with immigrant investor programs (Amante and
Rodrigues, 2020).14
In contrast to the Chinese migrants, Brazilian elites’ interest in Portugal, the
“option to exit Brazil” (Montezuma and McGarrigle, 2019), is closely related to
the search for a more carefree lifestyle and a better quality of life for themselves and
their families. Notwithstanding the unavoidable economic dimension of invest-
ment migration, Brazilian GV holders might be better defined as lifestyle migrants

================================================================================

because they are “relatively affluent individuals of all ages, moving either part-time
or full-time to places that, for various reasons, signify, for the migrant, a better
quality of life” (Benson and Reilly, 2018, p. 609). Unlike “regular” migrants who
also seek better lives and class mobility via far-flung jobs (Torresan, 2011), Brazilian
GV holders interviewed envision a better quality of life in tandem with a change
of scenery not necessarily related to career prospects. Rather, the object is to real-
ize an improved lifestyle for themselves and their families unencumbered by the
constraints they face at home in Brazil.
The desire for a more relaxed quality of life is reflected in comments concerning
security and professional competition. Security is ubiquitous in the narratives of
Brazilian immigrants in general (Schrooten et al., 2016), and the terms also pepper
the narratives of the Brazilian GV holders and their family members as we discov-
ered in our interviews. The anthropological work on violence in Brazil is extensive,
and security concerns are a pervasive element of urban life in many Brazilian cities
(e.g., Larkins, 2015; Penglase, 2011; Scheper-Hughes, 2006; Wacquant, 2003). As
Löic Wacquant observes, “Brazilian society remains characterized by vertiginous
social disparities and mass poverty, which together feed the inexorable growth of
criminal violence that has become the main scourge of the big cities” (Wacquant,
2003, p. 199). Ben Penglase’s argument that “urban violence provides Brazilians
with a ‘map’ which they can use to interpret their daily lives and organize their
social practices” (2011, p. 431) is also noteworthy. Penglase’s observations hint at a
link between perceptions of urban insecurity and the drive to emigrate (Adorno,
2002; Pinho, 2014). In a 2017 media interview about the new wave of Brazilian
immigrants arriving in Portugal, the Brazilian Deputy Consul General highlighted
the link between wealth and security in Brazil and the decision to leave the coun-
try, declaring that “they come in search of a more peaceful and secure life . . .
even though they have money they could not enjoy it due to the violence and
the Brazilian political crisis. . . . Here, they don’t need cars with bulletproof glass
windows.”15
These Brazilian GV holders were critical of Brazil’s urban violence and inse-
curity, fueled by poverty and social inequality (Wacquant, 2003; Penglase, 2011).
Débora, a Brazilian GV holder, stated that
The banality of violence in Brazil is absurd . . . For us, Brazilians, especially
for those from the urban areas, like Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, security
is really an issue . . . I lived in Copacabana. My office was located right in
the city center, a safe place, one might think. However, when I left work
at night, the sidewalk in front of the building transformed into a dormitory
for homeless people, beggars. It bothered me a lot and I started to think that
I couldn’t live in Brazil anymore. So, you see, the best place in Brazil doesn’t
even compare to the worst place here in Portugal.
The individuals we interviewed repeatedly highlighted personal traumatic experi-
ences as triggering their urgent desires to leave Brazil and prompting their decisions

================================================================================

to apply for GVs. They expected that life in Portugal would foster a safer lifestyle
and a more relaxed future. This is even more significant in the narratives of people
with children. Sandra, a teacher and a mother, observed that
Many people are very afraid. Like my husband, his ex-mother-in-law was
murdered, and since then he has been unable to live as he used to . . . living
in Rio changed a lot after that fact. So, security is not something I deny, we
have this . . . I was robbed at gunpoint once, but I don’t know . . . it didn’t
scare me. That was not what brought me here but living here I recognize that
it’s much more peaceful, and being a mother, I imagined my children walk-
ing alone to school. I wouldn’t do that in Brazil.
In a similar vein, Wilson, a male GV holder, commented,
We and our daughters have been in Portugal since 2015. In these four years,
we adapted to a calmer life. We still live in a private condominium and next
year our daughters will leave private school to attend a public school . . . can
you imagine? That would be impossible back home.
Brazilian GV holders view Portugal as offering a better quality of life, which
encompasses a less competitive environment in school and at the workplace, as
compared to what they experienced in Brazil. As Débora observed,
In Brazil, there are many people. For every job you want to get, there are
millions of candidates. You have to be the first, the best, in everything. We
are used to it. The level of competition in Brazil is higher . . . So, those who
came here are sharks, not golden fish.
Investors are part of a “new flow of Brazilians” coming to Portugal (França and
Padilla, 2018). They are highly skilled, a characteristic shared with previous flows
(França and Padilla, 2018; Torresan, 2011; Pinho, 2014). Although their privi-
leged economic status enables them to apply for a GV, they are not rich enough
to cease working while in Portugal. All our interviewees are professionally active
people and enjoy successful careers in the arts, finance, media, or advertising.
Some continue their line of work while others embraced a completely different
professional path.
Despite the often-negative stereotypes of Portugal mentioned earlier (Torresan,
2011) and in keeping with Montezuma and McGarrigle’s (2019) observations, we
find among our interviewees those for whom language, historical links, and shared
cultural terrain were intrinsic to their decisions to invest and ultimately live in Por-
tugal. This is not necessarily due to the past colonial relationship between Portugal
and Brazil but rather for more pragmatic reasons. For some of our interviewees, it
was a matter of choosing the easiest destination possible, in terms of adaptation to
a new social, cultural, and linguistic environment. Moreover, familiarity with other

================================================================================

Mobility Through Investment 231
Brazilians living in Portugal and an imagined cultural proximity attracted them. As
Vitória, a female GV holder from São Paulo, noted,
When I decided to come here, as I was moving with my family, the language
and climate were the things that mattered the most. I speak English, but my
husband, my daughter, and my mother speak only Portuguese, so . . . this was
important when I decided to come to Portugal. Also, in Germany, England,
or France, in these countries they don’t have the joy of life, there is greater
civility there, and everything works better . . . Maybe that is why we Brazil-
ian are the way we are, we were colonized by the Portuguese.
For Brazilian elites, moving to Lisbon is not quite the same as moving to Europe,
despite Portugal’s European identity. Brazilians, especially the wealthy ones, con-
sider Europe not as a geopolitical concept but as embodying a certain lifestyle
commonly associated with northwest Europe, including France. However, for
economic and linguistic reasons, Brazilian elites see their possibilities of living in
Europe as limited to Portugal. Nevertheless, we found our interviewees refer-
ring to Portugal as presenting several advantages which are relevant for our discus-
sion of GV holders and the blurred boundaries between migration and tourism.
Particularly, but not exclusively, retired investors were engaged in consuming the
Portuguese past through regular travel and visits to the country’s hinterlands or by
living in Lisbon’s historic neighborhoods: These pursuits directly link these Brazil-
ian residents to tourism and a more consumption-driven form of migration. Karen
O’Reilly (2003) argues that migration and tourism, which are often considered
separately, need to be brought together within research so that we can develop a
better understanding of the interrelations between these two types of movement.
Among the Brazilian GV holders, some of our interviewees’ initial encounters with
Portugal were as tourists. As Brazilian citizens do not need a visa to enter Portu-
guese territory for short periods, some came as tourists, stayed for several weeks,
and explored possibilities for relocation. Ultimately, they visited real estate agents
and lawyers’ offices to help them embark on the process of moving to Portugal.
In some cases, starting as tourists they became tourism promoters, investing in
travel agencies. Others work as consulting agents, assisting co-nationals wanting to
obtain Portuguese GVs. In either case, we can find here the “symbiotic relation-
ships between tourism and migration” that Allan M. Williams and C. Michael
Hall (2000, p. 7) refer to, namely through a “tourism entrepreneurial migration
[which] may constitute a special case of both lifestyle seeking migration and labour
migration” (Williams and Hall, 2002, p. 31) with individuals being, in the case of
Brazilian GV holders, first motivated by “quality of life considerations” (Williams
and Hall, 2002, p. 31).
On a different level, for many Brazilians, the relationship between investment
and tourism emerges from a perceived advantage of Portugal’s relatively central
location, which is often understood more as a place from which they can travel
rather than as a place in which to live. In this way, for many, it is primarily a

================================================================================

European base that maximizes travel possibilities. Sandra, a female GV holder,
explained to us that,
Portugal is the size of Piaui,16 for us everything is close, it’s all a matter of
reference . . . traveling two and a half hours, and being there, far away . . .
I think Portugal has a lot of cool places, it has a lot to offer despite being
small, it has so many travel possibilities. And I don’t know whether travel is
cultural in Brazil. There is an advantage, a Brazilian with higher purchasing
power, living in Portugal, makes it easier because it’s in the center, so we
can travel a lot. . . . Traveling from Portugal is a lot easier than from Brazil.
My parents bought an apartment here as a way to get their residence permit.
They travel a lot. It is great for them! Sometimes they come from Brazil and
stay in Lisbon for long periods; when my daughter was born, they were sup-
posed to stay for a year to help me, but during that period they also booked
“a thousand” trips to Europe.
When speaking Portuguese and having Portugal as their departure point, Brazilians
usually talk about traveling “to Europe,” instead of traveling around or in Europe,
thus expressing their perceptions of Portugal’s location: A place that allows them to
spend more time as tourists, both in the country of residence (Portugal) and abroad
(Europe and elsewhere). So, in a certain way, for Brazilian GV holders, investment
allows them a path not only to migration but also to tourism.
Conclusions
In this chapter, we examined the case of GV holders as an avenue for highlighting
the blurred boundaries between investment, migration, and tourism. By explor-
ing the political reasoning behind a specific policy that created a category and an
opportunity for mobility, we found a diverse array of motives for applying for GVs
among Chinese and Brazilian investors extending beyond the realm of economic
investment.
Chinese and Brazilians have very different historical and cultural ties with Por-
tugal. However, by centering on motivations underlying GV applications, we
unearthed striking commonalities. Among the similarities, we found that both
Chinese and Brazilians in Portugal expressed strong desires to exit their home
countries and abandon certain lifestyles. The desired lifestyle is not so much for
what Portugal offers but rather centers on the fact that Portugal does not suffer
from the problems pushing them away from their home countries. The GV offers
the opportunity to transform that dimension of their lives. However, in both cases,
Portugal is generally not the first option but rather the most viable, when com-
pared to different constraints that both groups face entering and/or living in North
America or other European countries. Nevertheless, in both cases, Portugal’s loca-
tion is perceived as advantageous for travel to other European countries or conti-
nents. The very different spatial scale that both Brazilians and Chinese use when

================================================================================

Mobility Through Investment 233
thinking about their home countries and Portugal tends to drive their maximiza-
tion of travel possibilities and therefore consumption-led mobility.
In this sense, the search for a better, less stressful European lifestyle seems to
exceed the desire to expatriate capital. In the Chinese case, for the mainland Chi-
nese GV holders effectively living in Portugal, the opportunity to enjoy a certain
educational atmosphere and a cleaner environment supersede economic concerns.
Hence, the idea that many Chinese invest in Lisbon to expatriate capital (Mon-
tezuma and McGarrigle, 2019) still needs further research. From the narratives
of the GV holders – both Chinese and Brazilians – we may conclude that they
are more interested in moving to change their lives than in investing their capital
(although clearly capital investment is part of the picture). In fact, these people live
in Portugal, many work there as well, and they are looking for a better quality of
life for themselves and their families. Thus, their motivations and practices greatly
resemble those of migrants.
Besides these common aspects, there are also some differences between the two
cases. Although both China and Brazil have long historical, colonial, and migratory
ties with Portugal, the language and cultural proximity between Portugal and Brazil
is much stronger and influences the Brazilian imaginary of Portugal. In contrast, for
the Chinese, despite the Portuguese presence in Macau from the 16th to the end
of the 20th century, no distinctive imaginary of Portugal was produced. The coun-
try remained largely unknown to most Chinese. Another contrast lies in primary
motivations for leaving. While in the Chinese case, families verbalize worries about
educational competition and pollution but do not explicitly mention political or
economic fears (possibly due to caution), in the Brazilian case, families are very vocal
about the banalization of violence and the political and economic instability.
Tourism was a common theme in both the state’s narrative and investors’ narra-
tives. The Portuguese state’s narrative of the attractiveness of investment in Portugal
not only encompasses economic, cultural, and geographical aspects but also high-
lights a tourist lifestyle that resonates with the motivations and expectations of the
GV holders who seek a new lifestyle rather than simply a place in which to invest
economically. In fact, the Portuguese state largely promotes the country through
tourist postcards, even though the main goal is to attract foreign investment. It is
quite interesting to note that in the case of the GV, the Portuguese state requires
residence in the country for just 14 days per year, meaning that the state does not
expect investors to have an interest in living in the country. However, for our inter-
viewees, residence in the country was revealed as more important than the capital
investment itself. The country’s touristic attractiveness makes it a viable candidate
for relocation not only by offering a more relaxed lifestyle but also for its location
in Europe and thus the possibility of easy travel to tourist destinations in Europe.
In several interviews with GV real estate investors, we found yet another connec-
tion with tourism: Tourist activities and investments come after living in Portugal,
boosting their economic integration in the country.

from the country. On the contrary, the investors’ experiences we encountered defy
conceptions of the investor as an entirely economic category and instead locate
the investor in the blurred and intersectional territory of migration and tourism.
Like migrants, they seek opportunities to leave their countries of origin to pursue
a better quality of life. This does not exempt them from having professional lives,
though they also share a tourist ethos in the sense that they choose a country that
promises travel opportunities they did not have before. For this reason, we suggest
that the GV investors in Portugal are more lifestyle investors than capital investors,
as they are more interested in shifting how they and their families live than in maxi-
mizing or hiding their capital.
Notes
1 In February 2021, the Portuguese government published new legislation on the GV
Program (DR 14/2021) announcing changes starting in January 2022. The key amend-
ment is the exclusion of all mainland coastal areas, namely, Lisbon, Porto, and the
Algarve, as real estate investment areas eligible for GV. The archipelagos of Madeira and
Azores remain eligible.
2 Elsewhere, we have discussed this policy as a “governmental technology” constituting
part of a neoliberal political project (Amante and Rodrigues, 2020; see also Rose and
Miller, 1992).
3 One reason for this is Portugal’s increased presence in international media (see
www.jornaldenegocios.pt/empresas/media/detalhe/destino-portugal-bate-recorde-
de-referencias-na-imprensa-estrangeira).
4 The category of tourist is also complex, and its conceptualizations are debated (see, e.g.,
McCabe, 2005; O’Reilly, 2003).
5 Chinese interviewees stated they preferred not to be taped. We experienced this pre-
viously in our long-term fieldwork with Chinese migrants in Portugal. This is not
necessarily for political reasons: It is linked to self-protectiveness vis á vis strangers and
non-Chinese (see Rodrigues, 2012).
6 Decree-Law n. º 249/2009, September 23. https://dre.pt/application/file/a/157238304.
7 A 2015 amendment lowered this requirement to ten people.
8 See http://portugalglobal.pt/PT/Paginas/Index.aspx.
9 We examined the 2020 website’s promotional film (images, text, and audio information)
as well as written incentives for investing.
10 In the Chinese case, rentals to co-nationals include short-term rentals to Chinese stu-
dents in Portugal and Chinese workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, GV holders’
houses were also used by other Chinese to quarantine.
11 See, e.g., www.scmp.com/business/article/3022507/portugals-golden-visa-program-
swamped-inquiries-hongkongers-seeking.
12 Additionally, as previous research on GV Programs indicates (Amante and Rodrigues,
2020), the Portuguese GV Program – as compared to similar programs in other Euro-
pean countries – is less expensive and more flexible in terms of working status and family
reunification.
13 Cascais is a fishing village near Lisbon, associated with economic and social elites.
14 Compared to other nations’ Immigrant Investment Programs, Portugal’ GV is a relatively
straightforward, low-cost option, requiring a real estate investment of half a million
euros. This contrasts favorably with the United Kingdom’s program, where the mini-
mum investment is one million pounds, and with France, which requires a minimum
investment of €10 million in industrial or commercial assets and job creation.
